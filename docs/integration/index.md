The Music Assistant HA Integration provides a connection between MA and HA. This means that MA players are visible in HA (but not currently the other way around) and can be controlled via the HA UI or via automations or scripts. With some additional setup voice control of MA via HA is also possible.

Music Assistant was originally designed to solely work with HA and as a result this tight connection has been maintained and installing the integration will also install the server as an addon. This provides a minimal effort and most secure way of getting up and running. However, this is not the only way and if you have installed the MA server elsewhere (or as an addon before) you will be able to configure the integration to connect to it.
